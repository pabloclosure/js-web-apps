* Minimalist example
This sections deals with the creation of the minimal, working,
NodeJS/Express application, the code shown here is part of the
=app.js= file in the =01minimalist= directory.

** app.js                                                          :noexport:
#+BEGIN_SRC js :tangle 01minimalist/app.js
// Minimalist NodeJS and Express application

<<01minimalist/app.js>>
#+END_SRC

** Installing 3rd party libraries
Run this commands on your shell/terminal, be careful that your
terminal should be at the location of the directory where you are
creating your application, you can know which directory your terminal
is on by looking at the "prompt" the piece of text that appears every
line preceding what you type. You can navigate to different
directories in your shell/terminal by using the ~cd~ command, followed
by a valid directory path.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
npm init
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
npm install express --save
#+END_SRC

** Requiring libraries
NodeJS and Express are frameworks. A software framework is a provider
of generic functionality that saves programmers from having to
re-invent the wheel in every new project. In our =app.js= file we will
want to load/import 2 frameworks, ~http~ and ~express~.

The ~http~ framework (https://nodejs.org/api/http.html) provides the
basis for creating an http server.

The ~express~ library (http://expressjs.com/) is built on top of
~http~ and provides an extra level of abstraction for creating web
services.

To import/load the libraries we need to call the built-in ~require~
function passing the desired library name as a parameter.

#+BEGIN_SRC js :noweb-ref 01minimalist/app.js
var http    = require('http');
var express = require('express');
#+END_SRC

** Creating the ~app~ object
The app object is created by calling the express library.

#+BEGIN_SRC js :noweb-ref 01minimalist/app.js
var app = express();
#+END_SRC

** Creating a route
Routes are blocks of code that get called when a client makes a
request to a particular url of the site, there are several ways to
define a route with the express library, the simplest of which is
calling theh ~get()~ method on our app object, we'll need to pass 2
things to this method, the route as a string and a function that will
be used as callback, this function in turn should take a request and a
response arguments.

#+BEGIN_SRC js :noweb-ref 01minimalist/app.js
app.get('/', function (request, response) {
    response.send('Welcome to the simplest web application.');
});
#+END_SRC

In this case we are using an anonymous function, however note that we
could achive the same thing by doing the following:

#+BEGIN_SRC js
var rootCallback = function (request, response) {
    response.send('Welcome to the simplest web application.');
});

app.get('/', rootCallback);
#+END_SRC

** Creating the server and putting it to listen
#+BEGIN_SRC js :noweb-ref 01minimalist/app.js
var server = http.createServer(app);
server.listen(8000);
#+END_SRC

** Running the server
Open a terminal and change to the directory that contains the
application js file.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
node app.js
#+END_SRC

Now you can open an webbrowser and navigate to http://localhost:8000
and see the web application in action!

* Responding with HTML
** Introduction
In this section, our NodeJS/Express application will respond to the
user not with strings but by returning a file, in this particular case
an HTML file.

** app.js                                                         :noexport:
#+BEGIN_SRC js :tangle (prog1 "02withtemplates/app.js" (make-directory "02withtemplates" "."))
// NodeJS and Express application
// With templating capabilities

var http    = require('http');
var express = require('express');


var app = express();

<<root-route-with-file-response>>

var server = http.createServer(app);
server.listen(8000);
#+END_SRC

** Responding with HTML
To respond to a request with html, we use the =sendFile()= method of
the response object. We can now modify our root "/" route to respond
with the =index.html= file instead of a string.

#+BEGIN_SRC js :noweb-ref root-route-with-file-response
app.get('/', function (request, response) {
    response.sendFile(__dirname + '/index.html');
});
#+END_SRC

Notice how the argument we pass to the =sendFile()= method is the
concatenation of the ~__dirname~ variable and the desired filename
prepanded with a forward-slash. The ~__dirname~ variable is set up by
the Node and contains the full path of the directory where the
=app.js= file is located at.

Of course we now have to also create a =index.html= file:

#+BEGIN_SRC html :tangle 02withtemplates/index.html
<h1>NodeJS/Express web application</h1>

<p>This time the server responded, not with a string but with this
  html file</p>

<p>Remember that html is nothing but a convention where one
  "surrounds" text with tags, and the web browsers node how to display
  the document to the end user</p>
#+END_SRC

** Running the server
Open a terminal and change to the directory that contains the
application js file.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
node app.js
#+END_SRC

Now you can open an webbrowser and navigate to http://localhost:8000
and see the web application in action!

* Responding with customized/processed HTML
** Introduction
In this section we configure our NodeJS/Express application to respond
with html that will be custom-made for every request via a templating
engine. A template engine is a processor of html documents, it extends
the html syntax allowing developers to insert commands in .html files,
that, when processed by the engine, are converted into valid html.

The templating engine we will utilize is *swig*
(http://paularmstrong.github.io/swig/). Be aware that I use swig for
now because it shares the same syntax with Python's Django/Jinja
templating engines (I come from a python background) so I might start
using different templating engines in the future.

** app.js                                                         :noexport:
#+BEGIN_SRC js :tangle (prog1 "03withcustomtemplates/app.js" (make-directory "03withcustomtemplates" "."))
// NodeJS and Express application
// With templating capabilities

var http    = require('http');
var express = require('express');

var app = express();

<<templating-engine-configuration>>

<<root-route-with-customized-html>>

var server = http.createServer(app);
server.listen(8000);
#+END_SRC

** Configuring the templating engine
#+BEGIN_SRC js :noweb-ref templating-engine-configuration
var swig = require('swig');
app.engine('html', swig.renderFile);
app.set('view engine', 'html');
app.set('views', './views');
#+END_SRC

** Responding with customized html
We won't be using the ~sendFile()~ method of our app object anymore,
we will replace it with the ~render()~ method. ~render()~ unlike it's
predecessor does not need the full path of the file, only the
filename. This is because we've already instructed our templating
engine where our views or templates are located at (see the previous
section). The ~render()~ method also takes, optionally, a context
object. The context object's attributes can be referred to inside our
html by following the templating engine syntax.

#+BEGIN_SRC js :noweb-ref root-route-with-customized-html
app.get('/', function (request, response) {
    var context = {
        randomNum1: Math.random(),
        randomNum2: Math.random(),
        randomNum3: Math.random()
    };

    response.render('index.html', context);
});
#+END_SRC

Now we'll create our index.html file, this time inside the =views/=
directory. Remember, the templating engine has been configured to know
that he should pull all the files we tell it to from a particular
directory.

Inside the html file we can use double curly braces ~{{ }}~ to refer
to a context variable, these curly braces won't actually appear on the
server response, but rather will be replaced by the actual value of
the data they refer to!

#+BEGIN_SRC html :tangle (prog1 "03withcustomtemplates/views/index.html" (make-directory "03withcustomtemplates/views" "."))
<h1>NodeJS/Express web application</h1>
<h3>Success!</h3>

<p>This html document is custom made for every request by our
  templating engine, this means the same html file can have keep the
  same structure but have different content for each user!</p>

<ul>
  <li>Random number 1: {{ randomNum1 }}</li>
  <li>Random number 2: {{ randomNum2 }}</li>
  <li>Random number 3: {{ randomNum3 }}</li>
</ul>
#+END_SRC

** Running the server
Open a terminal and change to the directory that contains the
application js file.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
node app.js
#+END_SRC

Now you can open an webbrowser and navigate to http://localhost:8000
and see the web application in action!

* Minimalist in memory application
** Introduction
This section is about creating an improved minimialist example. The
following code creates the web application for an online store whose
products data is located in memory.

** app.js
#+BEGIN_SRC js :tangle (prog1 "04minimalistinmemory/app.js" (make-directory "04minimalistinmemory" "."))
// NodeJS and Express application
// With in memory database

var http    = require('http');
var express = require('express');
var swig    = require('swig');
var _       = require('underscore');

var app = express();

app.engine('html', swig.renderFile);
app.set('view engine', 'html');
app.set('views', 'views/');

<<currency-filter>>

<<book-database-data-structure>>
    
app.get('/', function(request, response) {
    var mostLikedBook = _.max(booksData, function(book) { return book.likes; });
    response.render('index.html', { mostLikedBook: mostLikedBook });
});

app.get('/catalog', function(request, response) {
    response.render('catalog.html', { books: booksData });
});

app.get('/catalog/:bookName', function(request, response) {
    var book = _.findWhere(booksData, { bookName: request.params.bookName });
    
    if (!book) {
        response.status(404);
        response.end();
    }
        
    response.render('book-profile.html', book);
});

var server = http.createServer(app);
server.listen(8000)
#+END_SRC

*** Currency Filter
Here we extend the swig templating engine to have a currency
filter. Filters are functions that take something being referred to in
the html file and transform it. In this case the filter will work with
numbers, returning their human readable representation as a currency.

#+BEGIN_SRC js :noweb-ref currency-filter
swig.setFilter('currency',  function(value) {
  return '$' + value.toFixed(2);
});
#+END_SRC

*** Book Database Data Structure
This is the whole database of the site. In this case we have an
"in-memory" database because we are storing it in the RAM memory, the
same as our NodeJS/Express application. This of course has the
downside that is not scalable (we would soon run out of RAM) and that
any new data would be lost on a server reset.

#+BEGIN_SRC js :noweb-ref book-database-data-structure
var booksData = [
    {

** base.html
This html template won't actually be sent to our user. It is meant to
be reused by our other templates. You can think of it as a "skeleton"
for the others to build on. The ~{% block content %}{% endblock
content %}~ declares an area that the other templates can fill with
their own stuff.
